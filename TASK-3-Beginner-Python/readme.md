Stack overflow is your best friend.
  
Write programs to the specs outlined. You will find some starter code for each question in the TASK-3 folder
  
## Question 1
  
Write a Python program to display the current date and time.
Sample Output :
Current date and time :
2014-07-05 14:34:14

## Question 2
  
Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.  
Sample Output :  
r = 1.1  
Area = 3.8013271108436504  
  
## Question 3
  
Write a Python program to find whether a given number (accept from the user) is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
  
## Question 4
  
Write a program that prints a list of all the prime numbers up to and including a number supplied by the user
  
## Question 5
  
Given input from the user of a date in the form 'MM/DD/YYYY' and as a string, determine whether the date is in a leap-year
  
## Question 6
  
A certain magical die has varying probabilities of landing on one of it's 6 sides. These probabilities are given in the starter code in a dictionary. Create a function that returns an integer value representing a side of the die (1-6) for one roll. 

## Question 7
  
Use your code from the last question to roll the die 100 times, and then plot the results on a histogram using the seaborn library
