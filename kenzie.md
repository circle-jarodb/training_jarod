## General Outline of Steps

- [ ] TASK-0: Get your environment set-up  
- [ ] OPTIONAL: Update your Linkedin
- [ ] DEMO-0: Github:  
  https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world
- [ ] TASK-1: Forks and Things   
- [ ] TASK-2: Read Up to, but not including Regular Expressions   
- [ ] DEMO-1: Beginner Python  
  On the linked Google colab on this task, try to understand what all the code is doing in the cells up to regular expressions. Note: SHIFT+ENTER runs the current cell in the notebook. Also not all of the notebook my be expanded so make sure to cleak each of the hidden cells.
- [ ] TASK-3: Beginner Python   
- [ ] DEMO-2: Pandas Demo  
  I made this short notebook. You might also want to look at the Automate the Boring stuff book, I believe there is a chapter or section on pandas and numpy. 
- [ ] TASK-4: Pandas, Numpy, and Math   
- [ ] TASK-5: Read Up to, but not including Data Classes   
- [ ] DEMO-3: Intermediate Python   
  This is the same notebook from Demo-1, just go through the second half
- [ ] TASK-6: Classes    
- [ ] DEMO-4: API Demo
  This notebook has some code to help with the next task
- [ ] TASK-7: APIs   
- [ ] Go through "Automate the boring stuff" through Chapter 12
- [ ] DEMO-5: Basic Selenium   
- [ ] TASK-8: Automate   
- [ ] Chapter 13 through the end of "Automate the boring stuff"
 
When you come to demos, these are generally sessions I would go over material. Let me know if you would like them or if you would like a video for some. I have tried to provide supplemental materials or notes for the demos since you will be on your own.

Tasks do have deliverables generally and they should be uploaded to your copy of this repository, and then share that repository with me and I will give pointers.

You can look at the Demo-5 and Task-8, but really I would like you to start going through the book "Automate the Boring Stuff" before that. As we talked about, each chapter should have some more free form projects, if you could make a github repo (can use your circle account) and share it with me, just let me know what you have completed and I will review it.

I have my own copy of the book, which means I can also help with some questions.

Task-0 would only apply to your own machine. Here are some notes about it:    
  -Don't do task 0.0.0   
  -Dont worry about Task 0.7   
  -Dont worry about Task 0.9, but see if you have wsl on your computer. If not let me know and I will give you steps. This allows you to run a virtual linux command line on Windows and is super helpful in various scenrios, espcially as most programs we want to be compatable on windows and linux  
  -Dont worry about 0.10 for now  
  -Only do 0.11 if you would like your phone on your personal computer.   

Towards the end of your shift, if you could send me an email with a very brief summary of where you are at in the process, that will keep me in the loop. Also if you come across literally any question, you can put it in that email through your shift and I can respond the next day. 

Have fun with it! If you want to extend a project a little bit to have a little more functionality or error handling, do it.
