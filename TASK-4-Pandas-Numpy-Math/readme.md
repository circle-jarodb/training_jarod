## Question 1
Using the iris dataset that is already imported via the sample code. Create a pandas df that groups all flower measurements by the species and reports the median values. Save that to csv.

## Question 2
1. Import bid_data.csv
2. Remove all rows with nothing in them in the BID_STATUS column
3. Remove rows that are duplicates in the AUCTION_ID column
4. Handle missing data in all columns. Provide reasoning. I will give you descriptions of the columns, but if you need background, ask me.
5. Export clean data to bid_data_yourname.csv

## Question 3: Part 1
Load in the dataset, codys_cat_data.csv. This is some data recorded about each of my four cats. I need you to do some analysis for me.  
I would like some summary statistics of these four cats measurements. Knowing that, you might want to manipulate the data, but you do not have to.  

Please find:  
-Mean and Variance of Each Cat's tail length and weight

Variance equation:

## Question 3: Part 2
1. Load in the dataset from part 3. Create a program that finds the regression line for each of the four sets. We are assuming that weight is dependent on tail length and want to make a model to predict it. Use least squares regression to find a and b where y = ax + b and:

You may use functions that do sum and means for you, but no functions that do the least squares for you. 

2. Find the correlation of each cats measurments (i.e. r^2) where:

Again do not use any functions to do this for you other than mean or sum

## Question 3: Part 3
1. Using the linear equation you found for each cat, create a function that given the cat and tail length, would output a prediction for weight.
2. Use the previous function to create a prediction for a tail length of 1 to 20 at intervals of 0.1
3. Use seaborn to plot a scatter plot of the values, and then your regression line for all 4 cats. DO NOT USE seaborn regplot
4. Okay, now use seaborn regplot :) and compare
